# Spring

Spring is a stand-alone version of ModuleScript ported from [Quenty/NevermoreEngine/.../Spring.lua](https://github.com/Quenty/NevermoreEngine/blob/main/src/spring/src/Shared/Spring.lua), as of writing it seems like an API is missing for this, so I will add one in the future.

This module is intended to be used with [Wally](https://github.com/UpliftGames/wally), see the [package description](https://wally.run/package/brittonfischer/spring) for installation information. Or, just add the following as a dependency to your wally.toml:

```toml
ProfileService = "brittonfischer/spring@0.1.0"
```
